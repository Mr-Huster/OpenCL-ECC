OpenCL port: TODO
------------------

starting from https://github.com/masterzorag/ec_pure_c code, now we need to run
"ideally N point multiplication by scalar in parallel".

code needs to respect OpenCL 1.1 specification:
* http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/specs/opencl-1.1.pdf

avoid AMD/CUDA specific implementation about threads/wavefronts and friends, then we can move
and run this code on CPU/GPU/Accelerators without issue, again: respect OpenCL standard 1.1

I can test OpenCL code on:

	1. AMD E-350 / HD6310, Mesa OpenCL implementation, gentoo_x86:
	   check clinfo.PALM
	   #radeon @freenode

	2. Accelerator Cell B.E., IBM OpenCL implementation, Fedora Core_ppc:
	add OpenCL query result	
	
focus on device 1 first, get a working PoC, then move on device 2 and optimize.


bn_* functions uses a fixed length of 20 item, use a define and hardcode lenght.

alignment, %128 bits, each * 16 byte is good.

address space: write data struct for _constant and _local.

ideally _local address space is faster, use this where needed data reuse.

use async_work_group_copy when possible.
